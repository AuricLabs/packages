 * The `Aurora` component lets you add a Aurora Postgres or MySQL cluster to your app
 * using [Amazon Aurora Serverless v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/aurora-serverless-v2.html).
 *
 * @example
 *
 * #### Create an Aurora Postgres cluster
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc");
 * const database = new sst.aws.Aurora("MyDatabase", {
 *   engine: "postgres",
 *   vpc
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Create an Aurora MySQL cluster
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc");
 * const database = new sst.aws.Aurora("MyDatabase", {
 *   engine: "mysql",
 *   vpc
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Change the scaling config
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Aurora("MyDatabase", {
 *   engine: "postgres",
 *   scaling: {
 *     min: "2 ACU",
 *     max: "128 ACU"
 *   },
 *   vpc
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Link to a resource
 *
 * You can link your database to other resources, like a function or your Next.js app.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
 *   link: [database],
 *   vpc
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Once linked, you can connect to it from your function code.
 *
 * ```ts title="app/page.tsx" {1,5-9}
 * import { Resource } from "sst";
 * import postgres from "postgres";
 *
 * const sql = postgres({
 *   username: Resource.MyDatabase.username,
 *   password: Resource.MyDatabase.password,
 *   database: Resource.MyDatabase.database,
 *   host: Resource.MyDatabase.host,
 *   port: Resource.MyDatabase.port
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Enable the RDS Data API
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Aurora("MyDatabase", {
 *   engine: "postgres",
 *   dataApi: true,
 *   vpc
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * When using the Data API, connecting to the database does not require a persistent
 * connection, and works over HTTP. You also don't need the `sst tunnel` or a VPN to connect
 * to it from your local machine.
 *
 * ```ts title="app/page.tsx" {1,6,7,8}
 * import { Resource } from "sst";
 * import { drizzle } from "drizzle-orm/aws-data-api/pg";
 * import { RDSDataClient } from "@aws-sdk/client-rds-data";
 *
 * drizzle(new RDSDataClient({}), {
 *   database: Resource.MyDatabase.database,
 *   secretArn: Resource.MyDatabase.secretArn,
 *   resourceArn: Resource.MyDatabase.clusterArn
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Running locally
 *
 * By default, your Aurora database is deployed in `sst dev`. But let's say you are running
 * Postgres locally.
 *
 * ```bash
 * docker run \
 *   --rm \
 *   -p 5432:5432 \
 *   -v $(pwd)/.sst/storage/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
 *   -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
 *   -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
 *   -e POSTGRES_DB=local \
 *   postgres:16.4
 * ```
 *
 * You can connect to it in `sst dev` by configuring the `dev` prop.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {4-9}
 * new sst.aws.Aurora("MyDatabase", {
 *   engine: "postgres",
 *   vpc,
 *   dev: {
 *     username: "postgres",
 *     password: "password",
 *     database: "local",
 *     port: 5432
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * This will skip deploying the database and link to the locally running Postgres database
 * instead. [Check out the full example](/docs/examples/#aws-aurora-local).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### Cost
 *
 * This component has one DB instance that is used for both writes and reads. The
 * instance can scale from the minimum number of ACUs to the maximum number of ACUs. By default,
 * this uses a `min` of 0 ACUs and a `max` of 4 ACUs.
 *
 * When the database is paused, you are not charged for the ACUs.
 *
 * Each ACU costs $0.12 per hour for both `postgres` and `mysql` engine. The storage costs
 * $0.01 per GB per month for standard storage.
 *
 * So if your database is constantly using 1GB of memory or 0.5 ACUs, then you are charged
 * $0.12 x 0.5 x 24 x 30 or **$43 per month**. And add the storage costs to this as well.
 *
 * The above are rough estimates for _us-east-1_, check out the
 * [Amazon Aurora pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/pricing) for more details.
 *
 * #### RDS Proxy
 *
 * If you enable the `proxy`, it uses _Aurora Capacity Units_ with a minumum of 8 ACUs at
 * $0.015 per ACU hour.
 *
 * That works out to an **additional** $0.015 x 8 x 24 x 30 or **$86 per month**. Adjust
 * this if you end up using more than 8 ACUs.
 *
 * The above are rough estimates for _us-east-1_, check out the
 * [RDS Proxy pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/proxy/pricing/) for more details.
 *

     * Imagine you create a cluster in the `dev` stage. And in your personal stage `frank`,

     * ```
     *
     * Here `app-dev-mydatabase` is the ID of the cluster created in the `dev` stage.
     * You can find this by outputting the cluster ID in the `dev` stage.
     *
     * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
     * return database.id;
