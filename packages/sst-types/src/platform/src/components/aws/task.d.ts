     *
     * If you specify `containers`, you cannot list the above args at the top-level. For example,
     * you **cannot** pass in `image` at the top level.
     *
     * ```diff lang="ts"

     *     }

     * and it'll run locally in a **Tasks** tab in the `sst dev` multiplexer.
     *
     * Here's what happens when you run `sst dev`:
     *
     * 1. A _stub_ version of your task is deployed. This is a minimal image that starts up
     *    faster.
     * 2. When your task is started through the SDK, the stub version is provisioned. This can
     *    take roughly **10 - 20 seconds**.
     * 3. The stub version proxies the payload to your local machine using the same events
     *    system used by [Live](/docs/live/).
     * 4. The `dev.command` is called to run your task locally. Once complete, the stub version
     *    of your task is stopped as well.
     *
     * The advantage with this approach is that you can test your task locally even it's invoked
     * remotely, or through a cron job.
     *
     * :::note
     * You are charged for the time it takes to run the stub version of your task.
     * :::
     *
     * Since the stub version runs while your task is running, you are charged for the time it
     * takes to run. This is roughly **$0.02 per hour**.
     *
     * To disable this and deploy your task in `sst dev`, pass in `false`. Read more about
     * [Live](/docs/live/) and [`sst dev`](/docs/reference/cli/#dev).

/**
 * The `Task` component lets you create containers that are used for long running asynchronous
 * work, like data processing. It uses [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) on
 * [AWS Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html).
 *
 * @example
 *
 * #### Create a Task
 *
 * Tasks are run inside an ECS Cluster. If you haven't already, create one.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * const vpc = new sst.aws.Vpc("MyVpc");
 * const cluster = new sst.aws.Cluster("MyCluster", { vpc });
 * ```
 *
 * Add the task to it.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * const task = new sst.aws.Task("MyTask", { cluster });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Configure the container image
 *
 * By default, the task will look for a Dockerfile in the root directory. Optionally,
 * configure the image context and dockerfile.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Task("MyTask", {
 *   cluster,
 *   image: {
 *     context: "./app",
 *     dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To add multiple containers in the task, pass in an array of containers args.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Task("MyTask", {
 *   cluster,
 *   containers: [
 *     {
 *       name: "app",
 *       image: "nginxdemos/hello:plain-text"
 *     },
 *     {
 *       name: "admin",
 *       image: {
 *         context: "./admin",
 *         dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
 *       }
 *     }
 *   ]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * This is useful for running sidecar containers.
 *
 * #### Link resources
 *
 * [Link resources](/docs/linking/) to your task. This will grant permissions
 * to the resources and allow you to access it in your app.
 *
 * ```ts {5} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 * new sst.aws.Task("MyTask", {
 *   cluster,
 *   link: [bucket]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * You can use the [SDK](/docs/reference/sdk/) to access the linked resources in your task.
 *
 * ```ts title="app.ts"
 * import { Resource } from "sst";
 *
 * console.log(Resource.MyBucket.name);
 * ```
 *
 * #### Task SDK
 *
 * With the [Task JS SDK](/docs/component/aws/task#sdk), you can run your tasks, stop your
 * tasks, and get the status of your tasks.
 *
 * For example, you can link the task to a function in your app.
 *
 * ```ts title="sst.config.ts" {3}
 * new sst.aws.Function("MyFunction", {
 *   handler: "src/lambda.handler",
 *   link: [task]
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Then from your function run the task.
 *
 * ```ts title="src/lambda.ts"
 * import { Resource } from "sst";
 * import { task } from "sst/aws/task";
 *
 * const runRet = await task.run(Resource.MyTask);
 * const taskArn = runRet.arn;
 * ```
 *
 * If you are not using Node.js, you can use the AWS SDK instead. Here's
 * [how to run a task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_RunTask.html).
 *
 * ---
 *
 * ### Cost
 *
 * By default, this uses a _Linux/X86_ _Fargate_ container with 0.25 vCPUs at $0.04048 per
 * vCPU per hour and 0.5 GB of memory at $0.004445 per GB per hour. It includes 20GB of
 * _Ephemeral Storage_ for free with additional storage at $0.000111 per GB per hour. Each
 * container also gets a public IPv4 address at $0.005 per hour.
 *
 * It works out to $0.04048 x 0.25 + $0.004445 x 0.5 + $0.005. Or **$0.02 per hour**
 * your task runs for.
 *
 * Adjust this for the `cpu`, `memory` and `storage` you are using. And
 * check the prices for _Linux/ARM_ if you are using `arm64` as your `architecture`.
 *
 * The above are rough estimates for _us-east-1_, check out the
 * [Fargate pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/pricing/) and the
 * [Public IPv4 Address pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/pricing/) for more details.
