     * - A path like `/docs`

     *
     * @example
     *
     * To serve your Next.js app **from a path**, you'll need to configure the root domain

 *
 * @example
 *
 * #### Minimal example
 *
 * Deploy the Next.js app that's in the project root.
 *
 * ```js title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb");
 * ```
 *
 * #### Change the path
 *
 * Deploys a Next.js app in the `my-next-app/` directory.
 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
 *   path: "my-next-app/"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Add a custom domain
 *
 * Set a custom domain for your Next.js app.
 *
 * ```js {2} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: "my-app.com"
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Redirect www to apex domain
 *
 * Redirect `www.my-app.com` to `my-app.com`.
 *
 * ```js {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
 *   domain: {
 *     name: "my-app.com",
 *     redirects: ["www.my-app.com"]
 *   }
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * #### Link resources
 *
 * [Link resources](/docs/linking/) to your Next.js app. This will grant permissions
 * to the resources and allow you to access it in your app.
 *
 * ```ts {4} title="sst.config.ts"
 * const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("MyBucket");
 *
 * new sst.aws.Nextjs("MyWeb", {
 *   link: [bucket]
 * });
 * ```
